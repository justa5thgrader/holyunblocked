Whats up, TTheHolyOne Here. This site is honestly a really cool website I made a while ago, last year. I now work on holymods.dev

I no longer update this site. Feel free to download it and work on it now if you want to. Just credit me please. Other than that yeah, this is my first unblocked website. Personally in my opinion though, holymods.dev is way better I just need to add more proxys and games ;).
It was a great time working on this site. I am quite sad to see it go. I am moving on now and I will still try to be in the stopinterenetcensorship game but I personally do not enjoy it much anymore and it just isn't a priority for me now.


# HolyUnblocked

This is a website that unblocks multiple games, plugins, etc.. This website can not be seen by GoGuardian if you download and use the site locally. It can be seen if you use my replit domain. Some games uses embeds so if those embedded sites get blocked we will have to find a new site.

This of course is a great way of using it but if you want to make sure your Teacher can't see the website start by doing this!

- Start by clicking this link [Download](https://github.com/TTheHolyOne/holyunblocked/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) 

- After doing this all you have to do is open index.html or any other HTML file you want!
- I recommend bookmarking the home page so it isnt annoying to get to it again
