Hey, I'm guessing you just downloaded this from github or the website. Thank you so much for doing so! You are reading this because you need help so follow these steps. If you have the folder opened and see all these weird files and folders its easy. Find the file that says index.html once found double click it! If this opens text try this: Right click it by using two fingers and click OPEN WITH then click View!
This will make it so you can use the website without GoGuardian being able to see it! Unlike the website this cant auto update so when I code fixes and updates you have to do this every time :(. To know if you need a update go to the home page and look at the text in the top left. It way say Version: NUMBER and that would be your version. The next text will be Newest Version: NUMBER and if that is not the same number as the other text you need a update.
